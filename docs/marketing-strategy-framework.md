## 🎯 Overview

This framework helps indie developers and solo founders create comprehensive go-to-market strategies with **zero marketing budget**. It focuses on organic growth through viral content, guerrilla tactics, ASO optimization, and community building.

## 📚 Core Expertise

### RARRA Growth Framework
**Retention → Activation → Referral → Revenue → Acquisition**

Traditional funnel is AARRR (Acquisition first). RARRA prioritizes retention because:
- Retained users are cheaper than acquired users
- High retention enables sustainable viral loops
- Revenue comes from engaged, retained users

### iOS App Store Optimization (ASO)
- **65% of downloads** happen through App Store search
- iOS metadata limits:
  - App Name: 30 characters
  - Subtitle: 30 characters
  - Keyword Field: 100 characters (comma-separated, no spaces)
  - Description: 4000 characters (NOT indexed for search)
- **First 3 screenshots** drive conversion (7-second decision window)
- Landscape orientation claims more visual space

### Viral Case Studies
- **Formula Bot:** $220K MRR through content marketing
- **Tally:** $100K MRR via Product Hunt + community
- **Code Guide:** $42K MRR using educational content

### Platform-Specific Guerrilla Tactics

#### Reddit
- **90/10 Rule:** 90% genuine contribution, 10% self-promotion
- Build karma in target subreddits first (2-4 weeks)
- Use throwaway accounts for product posts (link to main later)
- Post on weekday mornings (8-11am EST)

#### Product Hunt
- Launch Tuesday-Thursday for best visibility
- Only **10% of submissions get featured** (post-2024 algorithm)
- Build supporter list of 50+ people pre-launch
- First-hour momentum is critical (rank by upvotes/hour)

#### Hacker News
- Use "Show HN:" prefix for product launches
- Modest, technical language (avoid marketing speak)
- Respond to every comment within first hour
- Best times: weekdays 8-10am PST

### Micro-Influencer Collaboration

**Target Sizes:**
- **Nano:** 1K-10K followers (highest engagement, most authentic)
- **Micro:** 10K-100K followers (balance of reach + trust)

**Compensation Models:**
1. **Product Seeding:** Free lifetime access (best for new apps)
2. **Affiliate:** 20-30% commission on referred sales
3. **Revenue Share:** Ongoing percentage for long-term partnerships

### Top App Store Markets (by Revenue)

| Market | iOS Share | Revenue | Localization Effort | Priority |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------------------|----------|
| **🇺🇸 United States** | 58% | ~$6.5B H1 2024 | Native English | **HIGH** |
| **🇯🇵 Japan** | 69% | ~$2.8B H1 2024 | Heavy (kawaii culture) | **MEDIUM** |
| **🇰🇷 South Korea** | 65% | ~$1.2B H1 2024 | Heavy (tech-savvy) | **MEDIUM** |
| **🇬🇧 United Kingdom** | 52% | ~$1.1B H1 2024 | Native English | **HIGH** |

| **🇦🇺 Australia** | 57% | ~$580M H1 2024 | Native English | **MEDIUM** |

**Markets to Avoid:**
- 🇮🇳 India: 92-95% Android, low LTV, high fraud
- 🇷🇺 Russia/CIS: High fraud rates, payment issues
- 🇨🇳 China: Regulatory complexity (enterprise only)

### Cultural Localization

| Market | Messaging Tone | Visual Preferences | Key Differences |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **🇺🇸 US** | Direct, benefit-focused, casual, FOMO-driven | Bold colors, action shots | "Get results NOW" |
| **🇯🇵 Japan** | Formal, indirect, detail-oriented | Kawaii, pastel, cute characters | Process > outcome |
| **🇩🇪 Germany** | Factual, technical, privacy-first | Clean, minimal, data-driven | Specs over emotion |
| **🇬🇧 UK** | Witty, understated, modest | Similar to US but less aggressive | Dry humor works |

**Impact:** Localization increases downloads by **128%** and revenue per country by **26%**.

### Viral Content Frameworks

#### WAVE Framework
- **W**ords (on-screen text hooks)
- **A**udio (trending sounds, voiceover)
- **V**isuals (before/after, demos)
- **E**motions (surprise, humor, satisfaction)

#### High-Performing Hooks
1. **Pattern Interruption:** "Stop scrolling if you [relatable pain]..."
2. **Before/After:** Show transformation in first 3 seconds
3. **Behind-the-Scenes:** "Building [feature] in real-time"
4. **Surprising Use Case:** "This app can do [unexpected thing]"
5. **Tutorial Marketing:** "How to [solve problem] in 30 seconds"

**Stats:**
- 63% of high-CTR videos hook in first 3 seconds
- Before/after works across ALL app categories
- 50% of consumers create UGC if brands provide guidance

### Viral Loop Mechanics

**K-Factor Formula:**
```
K = (invites sent per user) × (conversion rate of invites)
```

**Benchmarks:**
- K > 1.0 = Exponential growth (rare, exceptional)
- K = 0.5-0.9 = Strong viral growth
- K = 0.2-0.5 = Excellent for most apps
- K < 0.2 = Needs optimization

**Example (Dropbox):** 35% of daily signups came from referrals at peak.
